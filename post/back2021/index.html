<h3 id="sport-life">Sport life</h3>
<p>The most importantly things is that I lost weight near 27kg in a year. This was unimaginable to me a year ago.I actually make sports as a part of my life. Exercise can be a means of constantly challenging yourself to raise your willpower ceiling. Then you can use that willpower in other ways as well,Meanwhile,I konw the power of keeping and trying. The konwlegde apply for learning too, espacially when I debugging with code and learning English.</p>
<h3 id="program-learning">Program Learning</h3>
<p>This year has been a year of rapid progress in my programming skills. The knowledge learned in the classroom is far from enough, and more is self-study after class. I learned Andrew.Ng&rsquo;s &ldquo;Machine Learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deep Learning&rdquo; in courese, and started to build a training model by myself (under construction). Self-taught python crawler and front-end knowledge such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. on station B, and realized the crawling of popular attractions of a travel website and a dynamic web page of a certain brand. Android APP development is in preliminary study. Knowledge of data structures and algorithms stays at the school curriculum level, and can write some simple leetcode questions.</p>
<p>The most difficult problem in the learning process is not being able to concentrate enough, but it is not the inattentiveness in the learning process, but the inattentiveness in the content of the study. The scope of knowledge in the field of computer science is too broad. I want to learn in many fields, but first of all, time and energy are not allowed, and career development is not allowed. But how can you find something you love without trying it widely.</p>
<p>For this question, my current answer is to try bravely and pay the time cost. Finding the direction you love is more meaningful than the so-called &ldquo;development&rdquo;, that is, the success of self-meaning.</p>
<h3 id="language-learning">Language Learning</h3>
<p>The final exam can be passed by surprise, but language learning requires time accumulation. The first feeling after entering the university is that the English level is not enough. When looking for answers on stackoverflow, it is often difficult to read official English technical documents. Especially for professional reasons, it is not difficult to accurately express the original meaning of machine translation, so it is more necessary to improve your English level. Many students in this major have the dream of entering a big factory in the Bay Area, and so do I. Therefore, English skills have become a must.</p>
<p>Language learning, like learning other knowledge, also requires persistence. Especially someone like me who has a poor foundation and learned dumb English since childhood. In the last two months of 2021, listen to VOA for one hour a day, and write down the words that you don&rsquo;t understand. This kind of process is boring, but when I clearly feel the improvement of my listening ability, and I can even hear some slang words in English, the feeling is really wonderful.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Reading is probably the worst thing to do this year.Check out the reading software. I only read five books this year. For some unknown reason, the reading volume in college is less than that in high school. It may be that I lack the feeling of being busy in high school. I think even science and engineering students should read books on humanities, politics and economics. The highest form of programming is artistic creation. At the same time, for their own career development, economic books are also essential.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I have been in BISTU for a year and a half, from spitting on the school conditions, to accepting the reality, to regaining strength, setting my own goals, and moving towards them. From the joy of studying abroad, to the fact that the grade point is not high, the change of dumb English, the difficulty of rewriting the grades, and the yearning for a better life in the future. This year has been heaven, hell, heaven, hell.</p>
<p>Towards 2022 with a new attitude</p>
